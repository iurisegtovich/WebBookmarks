#sklogwiki
SklogWiki is an open-edit encyclopedia dedicated to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, especially that of simple
liquids, complex fluids, and soft condensed matter. SklogWiki is particularly oriented towards theoretical studies and
computer simulations. SklogWiki was started in 2007 and currently has 1,410 pages, in various stages of development.

#towhee
Towhee is a Monte Carlo molecular simulation code originally designed for the prediction of fluid phase equilibria using atom-based force fields and the Gibbs ensemble with particular attention paid to algorithms addressing molecule conformation sampling. The code has subsequently been extended to several ensembles, many different force fields, and solid (or at least porous) phases.
It is the hope of the developers that Towhee serves as a useful tool for the molecular simulation community and allows science to move forward more quickly by eliminating the need for individual research groups to rewrite routines that already exist and instead allows them to focus on algorithm advancement, force field development, and application to interesting systems.

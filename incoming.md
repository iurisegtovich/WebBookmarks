#ASCEND
http://ascend4.org/QRSlv 
ASCEND contains quite a bit of old C code, which means that although it
is open, some of the data structures are a bit difficult to understand,
it uses a number of global variables, isn't thread-safe and some of the
code is rather wordy. It would be nice to be able to rewrite some of
that.

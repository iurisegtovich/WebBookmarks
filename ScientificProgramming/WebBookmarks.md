# Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix Collection
The Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix Collection is a set of standard test matrices arising from problems in linear systems, least squares, and eigenvalue calculations from a wide variety of scientific and engineering disciplines. The problems range from small matrices, used as counter-examples to hypotheses in sparse matrix research, to large test cases arising in applications.

It's hard to ignore the wealth of statistical packages available in R/CRAN. That said, I spend a lot of time in Python land and would never dissuade anyone from having as much fun as I do. :) Here are some libraries/links you might find useful for statistical work.

    NumPy/Scipy You probably know about these already. But let me point out the Cookbook where you can read about many statistical facilities already available and the Example List which is a great reference for functions (including data manipulation and other operations). Another handy reference is John Cook's Distributions in Scipy.

    pandas This is a really nice library for working with statistical data -- tabular data, time series, panel data. Includes many builtin functions for data summaries, grouping/aggregation, pivoting. Also has a statistics/econometrics library.

    larry Labeled array that plays nice with NumPy. Provides statistical functions not present in NumPy and good for data manipulation.

    python-statlib A fairly recent effort which combined a number of scattered statistics libraries. Useful for basic and descriptive statistics if you're not using NumPy or pandas.

    statsmodels Statistical modeling: Linear models, GLMs, among others.

    scikits Statistical and scientific computing packages -- notably smoothing, optimization and machine learning.

    PyMC For your Bayesian/MCMC/hierarchical modeling needs. Highly recommended.

    PyMix Mixture models.

    SPOTPY SPOTPY is a Python tool that enables the use of Computational optimization techniques for calibration, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques of almost every (environmental-) model. The package is puplished in the open source journal PLoS One:
    https://github.com/thouska/spotpy 

If speed becomes a problem, consider Theano -- used with good success by the deep learning people.

There's plenty of other stuff out there, but this is what I find the most useful along the lines you mentioned.

#Sundials
SUNDIALS (SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers) is a suite of advanced computational codes for solving large-scale problems that can be modeled as a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, or as initial-value problems in ordinary differential or differential-algebraic equations. The basic versions of these codes are called KINSOL, CVODE, and IDA, respectively. Also available are extensions of these codes for sensitivity analysis (CVODES and IDAS) and a Matlab toolbox (sundialsTB) providing interfaces to CVODES, IDAS, and KINSOL.
http://sundials.wikidot.com/start
The SUNDIALS solvers are released open source, under a BSD license. The only requirements of the BSD license are preservation of copyright and a standard disclaimer of liability.

#lpsolve about "FREE" linear programming algorithms and modelling languages
http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/

https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/lp_solve/info
lp_solve solves pure linear, (mixed) integer/binary, semi-continuous and special ordered sets (SOS) models. lp_solve has no limit on model size and accepts both lp or mps input files. It can also be called as a library from different languages like C, VB, .NET, Delphi, Excel, Java, ...
lp_solve is written in ANSI C and can be compiled on many different platforms like Linux and WINDOWS.

#R on numerical
http://www.r-pkg.org/ctv/NumericalMathematics
The task view will not cover differential equations, optimization problems and solvers, or packages and functions operating on times series, because all these topics are treated extensively in the corresponding task views DifferentialEquations, Optimization, and TimeSeries. All these task views together will provide a good selection of what is available in R for the area of numerical mathematics. The HighPerformanceComputing task view with its many links for parallel computing may also be of interest.

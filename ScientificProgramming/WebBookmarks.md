# The Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix Collection is a set of standard test matrices arising from problems in linear systems, least squares, and eigenvalue calculations from a wide variety of scientific and engineering disciplines. The problems range from small matrices, used as counter-examples to hypotheses in sparse matrix research, to large test cases arising in applications.
